# Movie Grading with Sentiment Analysis
---

This is the project for George Washington University NLP for Data Science course worked by Kaiqi Yu, Zichu Chen, YaLiu.

In This Project, we cleaned our data and used several models to extract topics and analyze the sentiment of these reviews. For document clustering and topic extraction, we used k-means and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and compared the results of both of them. To classify movie reviews into positive and negative attitudes, we tried Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic regression. Also, we used the Textblob Sentiment function to give a score from 0 to 5 according to each review.
